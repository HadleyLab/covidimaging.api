  purpose of the CIFAI study is to develop medical AI that may improve
  our understanding of cancer imaging which may facilitate new ways of
  preventing disease.  To do this, we will ask you to securely donate
  your medical imaging and related health records to us through a
  secure web application.  CIFAI represents the first research study
  that engages patients to directly donate their imaging to develop
  medical AI.</FONT></P>

  pressure, cholesterol, smoking and other habits, and your history of
  cancer, if any. Surveys will be brief, and they will take you about
  5-10 minutes to fill out.  You may be asked to update your

    your cancer imaging on your personalized dashboard, such as cancer
    risk estimates, directly to you, which might prompt you to want to
    talk to your health care provider. Whereas there may be benefits to
    you from seeing your healthcare provider, there are also costs, and
    the CIFAI will not pay for any of your medical care. You should not
